<h2><a name="ss2.1">2.1 Multicast addresses.</a>
</h2>

<p>As you probably know, the range of IP addresses is divided into "classes"
based on the high order bits of a 32 bits IP address:
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<pre>   Bit --&gt;  0                           31            Address Range:
           +-+----------------------------+
           |0|       Class A Address      |       0.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255
           +-+----------------------------+
           +-+-+--------------------------+

<p>The one which concerns us is the "Class D Address". Every IP datagram whose
destination address starts with "1110" is an IP Multicast datagram.
</p><p>The remaining 28 bits identify the multicast "<em>group</em>" the datagram is sent
to. Following with the previous analogy, you have to tune your radio
to hear a program that is transmitted at some specific frequency, in the
same way you have to "tune" your kernel to receive packets sent to an
specific multicast group. When you do that, it's said that the host has
<em>joined</em> that group in the interface you specified. More on this later.
</p><p>There are some special multicast groups, say "well known multicast
groups", you should not use in your particular applications due the
special purpose they are destined to:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> 224.0.0.1 is the <em>all-hosts</em> group. If you ping that group, all
multicast capable hosts on the network should answer, as every
multicast capable host <em>must</em> join that group at start-up on all
it's multicast capable interfaces.
</li>
<li> 224.0.0.2 is the <em>all-routers</em> group. All multicast routers must
join that group on all it's multicast capable interfaces.
</li>
<li> 224.0.0.4 is the <em>all DVMRP routers</em>, 224.0.0.5 the <em>all OSPF routers</em>,
224.0.013 the <em>all PIM routers</em>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this special multicast groups are regularly published in the
"Assigned Numbers" RFC.
</p><p>In any case, range 224.0.0.0 through 224.0.0.255 is reserved for local
purposes (as administrative and maintenance tasks) and datagrams
destined to them are never forwarded by multicast routers. Similarly,
the range 239.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 has been reserved for
"administrative scoping" (see section 2.3.1 for information on 
administrative scoping).
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss2.2">2.2 Levels of conformance.</a>
</h2>

<p>Hosts can be in three different levels of conformance with the Multicast
specification, according to the requirements they meet.
</p><p><b>Level 0</b> is the "no support for IP Multicasting" level. Lots of hosts
and routers in the Internet are in this state, as multicast support
is not mandatory in IPv4 (it is, however, in IPv6). Not too much 
explanation is needed here: hosts in this level can neither send nor receive
multicast packets. They must ignore the ones sent by other multicast
capable hosts.
</p><p><b>Level 1</b> is the "support for sending but not receiving multicast IP 
datagrams" level. Thus, note that it is not necessary to join a multicast
group to be able to send datagrams to it. Very few additions are needed
in the IP module to make a "Level 0" host "Level 1-compliant", as shown in
section 2.3.
</p><p><b>Level 2</b> is the "full support for IP multicasting" level. Level 2 hosts must be
able to both send and receive multicast traffic. They must know the way
to join and leave multicast groups and to propagate this information to
multicast routers. Thus, they must include an Internet Group Management
Protocol (IGMP) implementation in their TCP/IP stack.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss2.3">2.3 Sending Multicast Datagrams.</a>
</h2>

<p>By now, it should be obvious that multicast traffic is handled at the
transport layer with UDP, as TCP provides point-to-point connections,
not feasibles for multicast traffic. (Heavy research is taking place to
define and implement new multicast-oriented transport protocols. See
section 
<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Multicast-HOWTO-9.html#sect-trans-prots">Multicast Transport Protocols</a>
for details).
</p><p>In principle, an application just needs to open a UDP socket and fill
with a class D multicast address the destination address where it wants 
to send data to.
However, there are some operations that a sending process must be able
to control. 
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>TTL.</h3>

<p>The TTL (Time To Live) field in the IP header has a double significance
in multicast. As always, it controls the live time of the datagram to
avoid it being looped forever due to routing errors. Routers decrement
the TTL of every datagram as it traverses from one network to another 
and when its value reaches 0 the packet is dropped.
</p><p>The TTL in IPv4 multicasting has also the meaning of "threshold". Its
use becomes evident with an example: suppose you set a long, bandwidth
consuming, video conference between all the hosts belonging to your 
department. You want that huge amount of traffic to remain in your 
LAN. Perhaps your department is big enough to have various LANs. In
that case you want those hosts belonging to each of <em>your</em> LANs to
attend the conference, but in any case you want to collapse the entire
Internet with your multicast traffic. There is a need to limit how "long"
multicast traffic will expand across routers. That's what the TTL is used
for. Routers have a TTL threshold assigned to each of its interfaces,
and only datagrams with a TTL greater than the interface's threshold
are forwarded. Note that when a datagram traverses a router with a certain
threshold assigned, the datagram's TTL is <em>not</em> decremented by the value
of the threshold. Only a comparison is made. (As before, the TTL is 
decremented by 1 each time a datagram passes across a router).
</p><p>A list of TTL thresholds and their associated scope follows:
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<pre>TTL     Scope
----------------------------------------------------------------------
   0    Restricted to the same host. Won't be output by any interface.
   1    Restricted to the same subnet. Won't be forwarded by a router.
 &lt;32         Restricted to the same site, organization or department.
 &lt;64 Restricted to the same region.
&lt;128 Restricted to the same continent.
&lt;255 Unrestricted in scope. Global.
</pre>
<hr>
<p>Nobody knows what "site" or "region" mean exactly. It is up to the 
administrators to decide what this limits apply to.
</p><p>The TTL-trick is not always flexible enough for all needs, specially
when dealing with overlapping regions or trying to establish geographic,
topologic and bandwidth limits simultaneously. To solve this problems, 
administratively scoped IPv4 multicast regions were established in 1994.
(see D. Meyer's "<em>Administratively Scoped IP Multicast</em>" Internet draft). 
It does scoping based on multicast addresses rather than on
TTLs. The range 239.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 is reserved for this 
administrative scoping.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>Loopback.</h3>

<p>When the sending host is Level 2 conformant and is also a member of
the group datagrams are being sent to, a copy is looped back by default.  
This does not mean that the interface card reads its own transmission,
recognizes it as belonging to a group the interface belongs to, and reads it 
from the network. On the contrary, is the IP layer which, by default, recognizes
the to-be-sent datagram and copies and queues it on the IP input queue
before sending it.
</p><p>This feature is desirable in some cases, but not in others. So the sending
process can turn it on and off at wish.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>Interface selection.</h3>

<p>Hosts attached to more than one network should provide a way for 
applications to decide which network interface will be used
to output the transmissions. If not specified, the kernel chooses a
default one based on system administrator's configuration.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><a name="ss2.4">2.4 Receiving Multicast Datagrams.</a>
</h2>

<h3>Joining a Multicast Group.</h3>

<p>Broadcast is (in comparison) easier to implement than multicast. It
doesn't require processes to give the kernel some rules regarding
what to do with broadcast packets. The kernel just knows what to do:
read and deliver <em>all</em> of them to the proper applications.
</p><p>With multicast, however, it is necessary to advise the kernel which
multicast groups we are interested in. That is, we have to ask the
kernel to "join" those multicast groups. Depending on the underlying 
hardware, multicast datagrams are filtered by the hardware or by the 
IP layer (and, in some cases, by both). Only those with a destination 
group previously registered via a join are accepted.
</p><p>Essentially, when we join a group we are telling the kernel: "OK. I 
know that, by default, you ignore multicast datagrams, but remember 
that I am interested in <em>this</em> multicast group. So, do read and deliver 
(to any process interested in them, not only to me) any datagram that 
you see in this network interface with this multicast group in its 
destination field".
</p><p>Some considerations: first, note that you don't just join a group.
You join a group <em>on</em> a particular network interface. Of course, it is 
possible to join the same group on more than one interface. If you don't
specify a concrete interface, then the kernel will choose it based on its
routing tables when datagrams are to be sent. It is also possible that
more than one process joins the same multicast group on the same interface.
They will all receive the datagrams sent to that group via that interface.
</p><p>As said before, any multicast-capable hosts join the <em>all-hosts</em> group
at start-up , so "pinging" 224.0.0.1 returns all hosts in the network that 
have multicast enabled.
</p><p>Finally, consider that for a process to receive multicast datagrams
it has to ask the kernel to join the group <em>and</em> bind the port those 
datagrams were being sent to. The UDP
layer uses both the destination address and port to demultiplex the
packets and decide which socket(s) deliver them to.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>Leaving a Multicast Group.</h3>

<p>When a process is no longer interested in a multicast group, it informs
the kernel that <em>it</em> wants to leave that group. It is important to understand
that this doesn't mean that the kernel will no longer accept multicast
datagrams destined to that multicast group. It will still do so if there are
more precesses who issued a "multicast join" petition for that group and
are still interested. In that case <em>the host</em> remains member of the group,
until all the processes decide to leave the group.
</p><p>Even more: if you leave the group, but remain bound to the port you were
receiving the multicast traffic on, and there are more processes that
joined the group, you will still receive the multicast transmissions.
</p><p>The idea is that joining a multicast group only tells the IP and data
link layer (which in some cases explicitly tells the hardware) to accept 
multicast datagrams destined to that group. It is not a per-process
membership, but a per-host membership.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>Mapping of IP Multicast Addresses to Ethernet/FDDI addresses.</h3>

<p>Both Ethernet and FDDI frames have a 48 bit destination address field.
In order to avoid a kind of multicast ARP to map multicast IP addresses 
to ethernet/FDDI ones, the IANA reserved a range of addresses for multicast:
every ethernet/FDDI frame with its destination in the range 01-00-5e-00-00-00
to 01-00-5e-ff-ff-ff (hex) contains data for a multicast group. The prefix
01-00-5e identifies the frame as multicast, the next bit is always 0 and
so only 23 bits are left to the multicast address. As IP multicast groups
are 28 bits long, the mapping can not be one-to-one. Only the 23 least
significant bits of the IP multicast group are placed in the frame.
The remaining 5 high-order bits are ignored, resulting in 32 different
multicast groups being mapped to the same ethernet/FDDI address. This means
that the ethernet layer acts as an imperfect filter, and the IP layer will
have to decide whether to accept the datagrams the data-link layer passed
to it. The IP layer acts as a definitive perfect filter.
</p><p>Full details on IP Multicasting over FDDI are given in RFC 1390: "<em>Transmission 
of IP and ARP over FDDI Networks</em>". For more information on mapping IP Multicast 
addresses to ethernet ones, you may consult <code>draft-ietf-mboned-intro-multicast-03.txt</code>: 
"<em>Introduction to IP Multicast Routing</em>".
</p><p>If you are interested in IP Multicasting over Token-Ring Local Area Networks,
see RFC 1469 for details.
